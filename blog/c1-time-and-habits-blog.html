  <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
  <p>One technique which i found quite useful was to set alarms. Some tools which i found quite useful were the Pomodoro Timer in Toggle and the Headspace App for iOS.</p>
  <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
  <p>I thought it was interesting what happens to the brain when we meditate and in particular, how we can use meditation to effectively manage anxiety levels and therefore reduce stress.</p>
  <p>I really like the quote "Confidence is just displayed ability". It emphasises the fact that confidence is earnt and is essentially a product or outcome of our abilities.</p>
  <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
  <p>I found the Pomodoro Timer helpful. I also found that the Headspace App was really good at keeping you into a routine.</p>
  <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>
  <p>I'm going to look into exploring more into micro habits and setting short term goals.</p>
