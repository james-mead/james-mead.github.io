            <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
            <p>Managing time can be quite a challenge. One such technique for managing time which i found quite useful was the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a simple, yet effective way to improve your study and work habits. The basic principle of the Pomodoro is that work is broken into 25 minute blocks. There a six objectives of the Pomodoro technique:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Find out how many 25 minute blocks or "Pomodoro's" are required by monitoring a specific task or activity</li>
              <li>Learn to protect your Pomodoro from both Internal and External interruptions</li>
              <li>Make accurate estimations of how many Pomodoro's are required for a certain task or activity</li>
              <li>Set aside some time for recap and review during your Pomodoro session</li>
              <li>Set a timetable according to your to do's, your time, location or season</li>
              <li>Find a personal objective such as being more effecient, or improving the quality of your work</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Another such technique for managing time was to set aside some time for meditation. Meditation has several benefits such as providing greater focus, creativity, memory recall, and reducing anxiety levels and stress. A really good App for meditation is Headspace.</p>
            <p>There are several other techniques and habits which I will be looking into more. One such technique is Micro habits, which is essentially setting yourself small behavioural goals.</p>
            <p>I really like the quote "Confidence is just displayed ability". It emphasises the fact that confidence is earnt and is essentially a product or outcome of our abilities.</p>
