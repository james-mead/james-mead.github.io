                  <p>
                    This week at EDA we were asked to read chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself and report back.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Mindfulness Relationship</h3>
                  <p>We were asked what is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?                  The difference between the two can be described as the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Self-awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>Self-awareness is the key domain of Emotional Intelligence. It's about knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions. There are three core competences of self-awareness:

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Body Scanning</h3>
                  <p>
                    Body scanning is a formal technique used to bring mindfulness to the body. I found this technique quite useful as one of the benefits is sleep, and i do love my sleep!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The body scanning technique is as follows:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Settling Attention</strong> - Start by sitting comfortably for 2 minutes in a postion that ensures you are both alert and relaxed at the same time. Now bringing attention to the breath, abdomen and entire body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Head</strong> - Bring your attention to the top of your head, ears, and back of your head. Notice sensations, or lack of sensations, for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Face</strong> - Move your attention to your face. Your forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, lips, mouth, and inside of your mouth (gums, tongue) for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Neck and Shoulders</strong> - Now, move your attention to your neck, the inside of your throat, and your shoulders for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Back</strong> - Move your attention to your lower back, mid back, and upper back for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Front</strong> - Now move your attention to the chest and stomach for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Entire Body</strong> - And now, bring your attention to your entire body all at once for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Scan for Emotion</strong> - Did you find any emotion in your body? If there is any, just notice its presence in the body. If not, just notice the absence of emotions, and catch one if it arises in the next 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Positive Emotion</strong> - Bring to mind a memory of a happy, joyous event. Now, bring your attention to your body. What does that positive emotion feel like in the body? Try this for 3 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Returning to Grounding</strong> - Bring your attention to either your body or your breath, whichever is more comfortable, and let’s just settle the mind there for 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3 class="section-heading">My Emotions Are Not Me</h3>
                  <p>
                    We usually think our emotions as being us. With enough mindfulness practise we now understand emotions as something we feel and not who we are as people.
