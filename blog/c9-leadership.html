                  <p>
                    This week at EDA we were asked to read Chapter 8 of 'Search Inside Yourself' by Chade-Meng Tan. I got to learn more about leading with compassion, influencing with goodness and communicating with insight.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Compassionate Leadership</h3>
                  <p>Compassion is seen as a key enabler for encouraging the highest level of happiness.</p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout my years of working in the commercial IT industry, I can give plenty of examples where managers weren't being as compassionate as what they could have been. The end product of staff being felt under-valued and eventually, leaving the organisation.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">The SCARF Model</h3>
                  <p>The SCARF model identifies the five domains of social experience that the brain perceives as primary rewards or threats. They are:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Status</strong> - is about one's seniority or relative importance. It can feel threatened quite easily by colleagues giving you "feedback", or rewarded when you improve a certain skill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Certainty</strong> - is great for the brain. In times of uncertainty, the brain reacts in a different way, taking up valuable resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Autonomy</strong> - is the perception of  exerting control over one's environment. Often it's not the stress itself that is debilitating, but the feeling of helplessness in the face of stress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Relatedness</strong> - is the perception of of whether another person is a "friend" or "foe".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Fairness</strong> - is about sacrificing one's own self-interest for the greater good.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Phase 0 has certaintly been interesting and given me many different obstacles and challenges to overcome. I have found the instruction material clear and precise which has given me certanty over what is required for sprints ahead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I suspect "Relatedness" will come in handy during Phase 1, as we are really going to have to work as a team to move forward from week to week.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">A Difficult Conversation</h3>
                  <p>Difficult conversations are conversations that are often important, but hard to have. There are 5 steps to conduct a difficult conversation. They are:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Prepare by walking through the "three conversations", e.g.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          What happened?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What emotions are involved? and;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What does this say about me?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Decide whether or not to raise the issue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Start from the objective "third story"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Explore their story and yours
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Problem solve
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    I can honestly say that I don't follow all these steps when navigating a difficult conversation, however moving forward these will come in handy.
