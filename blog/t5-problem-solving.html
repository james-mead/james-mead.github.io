                    <p>
                      This week at EDA we got to learn more about Javascript and in particular, how to handle listening events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What is becoming increasing more apparent is that fact there are many tools and solutions to a singular problem and it's important to do what you can with your own knowledge before engaging third parties.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Problem Solving Example</h3>
                  <p>Recently I got stuck on how to solve a problem with my blog site. I was trying to remove my mobile navigation menu when displayed on a desktop-sized screen. I worked through various resources online and found out i was not making proper use of media queries.</p>
                  <p>
                    Though frustrated at the time, it was worth pursevering with trying to find a solution so that i will be able to identify the problem and find a solution more quickly next time.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Problem Solving Techniquues</h3>
                  <p>There are a number of techniques and solutions out there when learning how to develop. Here are some of them:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Psuedocode - Pseudocode is a step-by-step verbal outline of your code that you can later transcribe into a programming language. It is a combination of human language and programming language and is used to mimic the syntax of actual computer code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Trying Something - Exactly as it sounds, trying something is better than trying nothing. At the very least you have something to work with and is an important step if you wish to debug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Rubber Duck Method - Involves explaining your problem to an inanimate object. Trough this process you will be asking the following questions:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          What is the problem?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What do I know?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What don't I know?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reading Error Messages - Involves scanning the output of a console or file in order to known exactly what's going wrong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Console Logging - Use 'console.log' to inspect variables and their associated values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Google - Yes, that right. Google can be a powerful resource when working out a problem. Chances are someone somewhere has come across the same problem as you're having.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Asking your peers for help - Shared knowledge is powerful. Try reaching out to your peers to see if they have come across a similar problem. Similarly, if you find a solution to a problem, share that knowledge around. You will save someone a great deal of time and pain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Asking coaches for help - Sometimes problems can't be solved within the context of the team and you may need to reach out for professional help. Be sure to answer the following questions:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          What you expect the code to do?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What it actually does?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Any error messages you receive?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reflect - Reflection is an important part of learning. Take some time to reflect on your recent problem.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Which approaches worked well?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What did I get stuck on?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Why did it take so long to resolve a bug?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          How long did it take to isolate the bug?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Did I stay calm?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Did my mindset help or hinder me?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What were the troubleshooting strategies/patterns that helped?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    I personally find all of the techniques above useful when problem solving, however i need to leverage my peers and networks more.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Explaining Javascript Array Functions</h3>
                  <p>We were asked to explain what the following array functions are used for to a non-technical friend. They are:<p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <strong>.map()</strong> - The .map() method is used for creating a new list by returning the <strong>results</strong> of a task performed on a series of values in another list. For example:</br>
                        If I have the values of 1, 2 and 3, and I want to perform the task of timesing each value by 2, then the <strong>resulting</strong> numbers would be 2, 4 and 6 in the new list.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>.filter()</strong> - The .filter() method is used for creating a new list by returning the <strong>results</strong> of applying a filter on another list. For example:<br />
                        If we take the same example numbers as above and apply a filter of 'all even numbers', then the resulting list would only have the number 2.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>.reduce()</strong> - The .reduce() method is used for returning the results of adding all the values of an array together. For example: var numbers = [5, 5, 2] //  result would be 12
                      </li>
                    </ol>
