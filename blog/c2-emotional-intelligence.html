                    <p>I have just finished reading the first chapter of <strong>Search Inside Yourself</strong> which is a book written by Chade-Meng Tan who is a Google Engineer. Below are some of my learnings.</p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, evaluate and manage emotions and is a technique that is developed through mindfulness and meditation and is one of the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life. Benefits
                        include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stellar work performance</li>
                        <li>Outstanding leadership</li>
                        <li>The ability to create the conditions for happiness</li>
                    </ol>
                    It can be broken down in to the following domains:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Self-awareness: Knowledge of one's internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions</li>
                        <li>Self-regulation: Management of one's internal states, impulses, and resources</li>
                        <li>Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                        <li>Empathy: Awareness of other' feelings, needs and concerns</li>
                        <li>Social Skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Stellar Work Performance</h3>
                    <p>Studies have shown that Emotional Intelligence is twice as important for excellence as pure intellect and expertise.</p>
                    <h3>Outstanding Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Studies show Emotional Intelligence make better people leaders and are often attributed to creating better work environements with the ability to use their interpersonal skills to better interact with co-workers.</p>
                    <h3>The Ability To Create The Conditions For Happiness</h3>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence enable us to use skills that help create conditions for happiness. Happiness is a skill that can trained.</p>
                    <h3>Two minutes of mindfulness</h3>
                    <p>
                        I found that using the <strong>affect labeling</strong> technique meant i could label how i was feeling at a specific point in time and studies have shown this to be effective at lessening the impact it has on our emotional well-being.
