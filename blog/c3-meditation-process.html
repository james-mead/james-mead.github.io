                  <h3 class="section-heading">Process Over Product</h3>
                  <p><strong>Process over Product</strong> is about recognising the importance of working learnings as opposed to being just focused on an outcome. I found this concept useful when developing my website as I was more encouraged to explore and learn new things which will benefit me long term, as opposed to being focused just on delivery. </p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 2</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am just about to read Chapter 2 of <strong>Search Inside Yourself</strong> by Chade-Meng Tan and we've been asked to share our thoughts thus far. Already I have found value in the learnings from the previous chapter. I am meditating for 10 minutes a day and I noticed immediate results such as greater focus, calmness and happiness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After reading Chapter 2, I now understand that meditation is purely just mental training and that mindfulness has two important faculties, <strong>Attention and Meta-attention</strong>.<br />
                    We understand the concept of attention and that it is essentially taking possession of the mind, in a clear and vivid form, but what is Meta-attention? Meta-attention is recognising that your attention has wandered away and that you need to bring it back to focus. Meta-attention is the secret to concentration and the better you get at it, the easier it is to concentrate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also learned that you can be alert and relaxed at the same time when meditating. One of the benefits of strong attention and meta-attention is increased focus and calmness.

                <p>
                  When our mind is calm and clear, happiness flourishes. Happiness is not something that is earnt or you pursue, rather it is our minds default state of being.

                  There are many ways to meditate, but here are a few golden rules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Back straight “like an arrow”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Legs crossed in “lotus position”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Shoulders relaxed, held up and back, “like a vulture”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Chin tucked in slightly, “like an iron hook”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Eyes closed or gazing into space
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tongue held against the upper palate”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “Lips slightly apart, teeth not clenched”
                  </li>
                </ol>
