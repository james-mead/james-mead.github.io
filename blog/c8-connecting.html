                    This week at EDA we were asked to read Chapter 7 of 'Search Inside Yourself' by Chade-Meng Tan. I got to learn more about the way Empathy works at a neural level and how it is revealed in the brain. What was interesting is that we can increase empathy with kindness.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Loving Kindless Meditation</h3>
                  <p>We were asked to explore the Loving Kindless and Mediation exercise which essentially is about wishing good wishes on others close to us.</p>
                  <p>
                    I found quite calm and happy after this exercise. Sometimes we are just so tied up in our everyday lives that we don't have time to sit and reflect on our loved ones.

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Trust and Sincerity</h3>
                  <p>
                    Trust is an important part to any relationship. Empathy is great but without trust, people become suspicious of you and put up a barrier to protect themselves from you. Trust is essential in the workplace and can either make you or break you. The same goes for sincerity. If you are not sincere, how can you earn someone's trust?

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Political Awareness</h3>
                  <p>
                    Political awareness is a great tool for preparing yourself for any organisation and involves reading an organisations' emotional currents and power relationships. In the example below i will take a conflict situation that has occurred in the last year and describe the situation as if both parties were 100 percent correct and reasonable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Situation:</strong></br>
                    Recently I had lunch with my wife in town who is a senior member of an organisation that she works for. After lunch i opened my laptop up and did some work near her desk prior to my next meeting in town. Soon afterwards a colleague of hers came into her office and in front of me said it was unproffessional and inappropriate that I was sitting there and that i needed prior approval from the CEO to work there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>My Argument:</strong></br>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        This is not a usual occurrence and whoever my wife has in her office as senior member of staff is her business. If this had been an external partner, this would have be highly embarrassing.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I found it somewhat contradictory. What was unprofessional is having this conversation in front of the guest in the first place. She could have easily had the conversation after i had left.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This type of behaviour doesn't really empower staff or let them feel valued. I found it unreasonable that a senior member of staff must request approval for a guest to work nearby.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Colleague's Argument:</strong></br>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        It's inappropraite that a husband or wife can come into a colleagues place of work and possibly distract workers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        She should be leading by example as a senior member of staff. It wouldn't be fair to other staff members.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This is a professional setting and husbands/wife's aren't allowed. 
                      </li>
                    </ol>
