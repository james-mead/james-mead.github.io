                  <p>The way people learn is changing. EDA offers a new approach to learning which is fully immersive, iterative, high paced and puts learning in the hands of the individual. The course not only teaches technical skills, but helps develop a lot of soft skills which are a necessity in order to become a great developer.</p>
                  <p>First impressions of this course tell me that you only get out what you put in and it really depends on the individual as to how well one succeeds. I like the agile approach to learning and the fact that each week is organised into sprints, just like a dev team in a workplace environment. I also like the fully immersive learning style as i find this the best way to learn. I was a little surprised to know that Dev Academy's course curriculum differs from Dev Boot Camp's, however i see this as a positive.</p>
                  <p>It's encouraging to see the amount of passion and excitement from not only the teachers but the students who are currently studying at Dev Academy.</p>
                  <p>The culture is a little new to me. Although I traditionally work at pace and take a more agile approach to development and implementation, I have historically worked in isolation. This is due to the nature of work I have worked in. I'm exited to work as part of a team again and to see what strengths each person brings.</p>
                  <p>It's always both exciting and nerve-wracking trying something new. I am changing careers and I will also be changing location at the end of this course, so that will make things a little challenging.</p>
