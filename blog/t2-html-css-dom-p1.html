            <h3>HTML, CSS and the DOM</h3>
            <p>This week we got to learn more about HTML, CSS and the Document Object Model. We have been asked to come up with an analogy which best describes what each does and the relationship between them.</p>
            <p>
              I like the anology of building a house. If the Document Object Model is essentially the framework for how a house should be built, HTML is the tools used for putting the house together, and CSS is used to style the house how you would like it.

              <h3>Boxifying Content</h3>
              <p>
                Boxifying content is essentially the pracise of breaking down each element on a webpage into a series of logical "boxes". By boxifying each element, it makes designing a webpage much easier.

              <h3>The Box Model</h3>
              <p>All HTML elements can considered as boxes. The <strong>"Box Model"</strong> is used when talking about design and layout. Essentially each element on a page has a box which consists of content, padding, a border and a margin. Please see the illustration below:</p>
              <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/boxModel.png" alt="Block Model"/>
